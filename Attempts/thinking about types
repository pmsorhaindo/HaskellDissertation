with actual type

`(Array Vertex [Vertex], Int -> (Maybe Ant, Point, [Point]), Point -> Maybe Vertex)'


Expected type:

(((Graph, Vertex -> (Maybe Ant, Point, [Point]), Point -> Maybe Vertex),
        (Graph, Vertex -> (Maybe Ant, Point, [Point]), Point -> Maybe Vertex)),
((Graph, Vertex -> (Maybe Ant, Point, [Point]), Point -> Maybe Vertex),
        (Graph, Vertex -> (Maybe Ant, Point, [Point]), Point -> Maybe Vertex))) -> (GraphATuple, GraphATuple)
      
Actual type: (GraphATuple, GraphATuple) -> (t0, Int -> (Maybe (Maybe Ant), t10, t20), t1)
